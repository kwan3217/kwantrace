  /** A mathematical ray, starting at an initial point \f$\vec{r}_0\f$ and continuing in direction
   * \f$\vec{v}\f$. This can be used as a vector function of a single parameter \f$\vec{r}(t)=\vec{r}_0+\vec{v}t\f$.
   *
   * The direction vector does not have to be unit length, but if it is unit length, then the \f$t\f$
   * parameter just represents the distance along the ray.
   *
   * Note that it doesn't make sense to have a zero direction vector. Such a ray would never leave the initial point,
   * no matter what the parameter was. This class will work perfectly fine, but most likely
   * all intersect functions will be asked to divide by zero at some point.
   *
   * This class is mostly a container for the vector coefficients, which are directly used by the intersection
   * routines in kwantrace::Primitive.intersect() . Those routines are responsible for determining if a given
   * ray actually hits anything.
   *
   * The ray does support a couple of operators, to handle evaluating the ray at a given parameter,
   * transforming with a matrix, and advancing the ray (generating a new ray which starts at a given parameter
   * from the old ray).
