     *    \f$
     * Any ray has the form \f$\vec{r}(t)=\vec{r}_0+\vec{v}t\f$. Broken down into
     * components, it becomes:
     *
     *    * \f$x(t)=x_0+v_xt\f$
     *    * \f$y(t)=y_0+v_yt\f$
     *    * \f$z(t)=z_0+v_zt\f$
     *
     * Any surface whatsoever, no matter how twisted, can be defined in the form
     * \f$f(\vec{r})=0\f$. This is easier to imagine on a contour map.
     *
     * \image html Contour3D.jpg height=320px
     *
     * \image html Contour2D.png
     *
     * Imagine a topographical map of terrain -- it has two dimensions (since it's on paper)
     * but has a third value at each point, the height. You can draw contour lines
     * on the map connecting all the points at a given altitude. The beach might be labeled
     * with height 0. A mountain would have a set of contour lines around the peak, generally
     * getting smaller as the altitude gets higher.
     *
     * \image html Courbe_niveau.png
     *
     * The beach sea level defines a curve on the map. If the topography was all raised (or equivalently
     * the water was lowered) the water would define a different curve. With the right topography and
     * water level, literally *any* curve can be generated. We say that with some height field \f$h(x,y)\f$
     * the beach curve is where \f$h(x,y)=0\f$. You can define different curves at height \f$k\f$ by
     * looking for where \f$h(x,y)=k\f$ or equivalently define a different function \f$h'(x,y)=h(x,y)-k\f$
     * and look for where \f$h'(x,y)=0\f$. So, any curve whatsoever can be defined by *some* function
     * \f$f(x,y)=0\f$
     *
     * We can play the same game in three dimensions. Imagine space filled with a field with a field
     * of scalars \f$f(x,y,z)\f$ where there is a value at each point. One example is the temperature in a room.
     * Much like a beach sea level defines a curve, there is a *surface* defined for any value of
     * the field \f$f(x,y,z)=k\f$ or \f$f'(x,y,z)=f(x,y,z)-k=0\f$.
     *
     * Now we use the ray formulas to find each coordinate as a function of \f$t\f$,
     * and plug that into our equation and get:
     *
     *    * \f$f(\vec{r}(t))=f(x_0+v_xt,y_0+v_yt,z_0+v_zt)=0\f$
     *
     * which is a single scalar equation with a single unknown. All parameter values \f$t\f$
     * which satisfy this equation represent intersections between the surface and the ray.
     * It might be complicated -- it might even be impossible to solve in closed form. But,
     * by hook or by crook, we are going to find those values such that \f$f(\vec{r}+\vec{v}t)=0\f$.
     * We call such \f$t\f$ values *roots*. The job of Primitive::intersect() and its overrides
     * *is* to solve this equation for \f$t\f$. This might mean running the quadratic formula,
     * it might mean solving some more complicated cubic, quartic, transcendental, etc equation.
     * Or, it might even be something linear, like a plane.
     *
     * A root is just as good as a point, because you can put the root into the ray parametric
     * equation and get the intersection point out. There is even Ray::operator()(double) to
     * evaluate this directly.
     *
     * The equation might have no solutions when given a particular ray -- for instance, a lot of
     * primitives like spheres, cylinders, and cones, can be described by quadratic equations.
     * A quadratic equation might have two real roots, one real root, or no real roots at all.
     * If the ray has two roots, this represents the case where the ray passes through the
     * primitive and intersects the surface in two places (think entrance and exit). If it has
     * only one root, this represents the case where the ray just grazes the surface. If there
     * are no real roots, this represents the case where the ray completely misses the surface.
     *
     * Roots can be positive, negative, or zero. If they are negative, that means that they
     * occur on the half of the ray which doesn't really exist. You can think of it as
     * behind the camera or whatever. If \f$t=0\f$, we once again have the literally infinitesimal
     * case of the plane passing exactly through the ray initial point, IE through the camera pinhole.
     *
     * Your primitive might have some kind of constraint. For instance, the quadratic definition
     * of a cone is infinite. If you want to have a finite cone like you would put ice cream in,
     * you have to apply a constraint. Say that your cone axis is the Z axis, and the vertex
     * is at the origin. Also say that you want a finite cone that is only one unit tall, or in
     * other words runs from z=0 to z=1. Now suppose you have a ray that hits the infinite cone
     * at z=2. In this case, the constraint is not satisfied, so this root doesn't count.
     * If no other root satisfies the constraint, there is no intersection even though the ray would
     * hit the infinite continuation of your constrained primitive.
     *
     * So, set the output parameter `t` to the one with the smallest positive \f$t\f$ that
     * satisfies the constraint, then return true. If there are no intersections, or if all
     * intersections have negative \f$t\f$, or they all don't satisfy the constraint, return false.
     *
     * @param[in]  rayLocal ray in local object space
     * @param[out] t        Position of intersection
     * @return              True if object is intersected by this ray. Output parameter t is unspecified if function returns false. 
     *
     * Note that if the return value is false, the output parameter `t` is unspecified. This means
     * callers of this function are not allowed to make any use of the `t` parameter they get
     * if the function returns false. The implementations of this function are allowed to 
     * stick any value they want here, or not change the parameter at all (which means
     * it will still have the same value as when it was passed in). The value may be NaN, infinity,
     * or some finite value that *still* doesn't mean anything to any outside process. For instance,
     * the implementation might do a partial computation, then hit a check that decides that
     * the ray doesn't hit the primitive. The implementation is fully within its rights to
     * leave the partial computation in `t`.

     * but that can be thought of as a combination of a rotation and non-uniform scaling.

     *
     * Since the *fundamental* property of a normal is that its angle to the surface is a
     * right angle, it is a problem that angles are not preserved. Therefore we have to
     * think about it a different way. The following derivation follows that of
     * https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci373s1c/PatricesLectures/2011/CS373-Part1-Lecture11-RayTracing3.pdf ,
     * slide 11.
     *
     * Assume there is some matrix \f$\MM{Q}{_{wb}}\f$ which properly transforms a
     * normal from body to world coordinates. Let's hope there is, and that it is uniform over space (doesn't depend on
     * \f$\vec{r}\f$) or on the actual shape of the surface (doesn't depend on normal vector \f$\vec{n}\f$). If this turned out
     * to not be the case, we would have to do something more complicated. As it so happens, there is a solution, and
     * it only depends on \f$\MM{M}{_{wb}}\f$. That's the wonderful thing about linear algebra, is that it's *linear*.
     * Starting from the assumption that there *is* an answer, we
     * will construct the answer and show that it only depends on \f$\MM{M}{_{wb}}\f$
     *
     * Imagine the direction vectors \f$\vec{p}\f$ parallel to the surface
     * and therefore perpendicular to the normal \f$\vec{n}\f$. There are an infinite number of such vectors, and what
     * we do below has to apply to them all, so it can't depend on the particular value of \f$\vec{p}\f$.
     * Therefore \f$\vec{n}\cdot\vec{p}=0\f$. Considering the vectors to be column
     * vectors, we can express the dot product as a matrix product if we transpose
     * the first vector, so we have \f$\M{n}\T\M{p}=0\f$.
     *
     * These vectors \f$\vec{p}\f$ *do* obey the \f$\MM{M}{_{wb}}\f$ transformation, since they must follow
     * the surface, and the surface certainly does obey the transformation. We will have
     * \f$\vec{p}_w=\MM{M}{_{wb}}\vec{p}_b\f$.
     *
     * Any new normal \f$\vec{n}_w\f$ must still be perpendicular, so it must be true that
     * \f$\vec{n}_w\cdot\vec{p}_w=0\f$, or \f$\MM{n}{_w}\T\MM{p}{_w}=0\f$. We substitute in
     * \f$\vec{n}_w=\MM{Q}{_{wb}}\vec{n}_b\f$ and \f$\vec{p}_w=\MM{M}{_{wb}}\vec{p}_b\f$
     * into our matrix dot product and come up with:
     *
     * \f$(\MM{Q}{_{wb}}\MM{n}{_b})\T(\MM{M}{_{wb}}\MM{p}{_b})=0\f$
     *
     * Now it's just linear algebra:
     *
     *  \f$\begin{eqnarray*}
     *  0&=&(\MM{Q}{_{wb}}\MM{n}{_b})\T(\MM{M}{_{wb}}\MM{p}{_b}) \\
     *   &=&(\MM{n}{_b}\T\MM{Q}{_{wb}}\T)(\MM{M}{_{wb}}\MM{p}{_b}) \\
     *   &=&\MM{n}{_b}\T\MM{Q}{_{wb}}\T\MM{M}{_{wb}}\MM{p}{_b} \\
     *  \end{eqnarray*}\f$
     *
     *  If that middle cluster of matrices simplified into an identity matrix, we would
     *  be left with \f$\MM{n}{_b}\T\MM{p}{_b}=0\f$, which is assumed to be true as our starting
     *  condition. So, [all we have to do now is to take these lies and makes them true
     *  somehow...](https://youtu.be/diYAc7gB-0A?t=127) We assume that the middle cluster of matrices
     *  is identity, then solve for \f$\MM{Q}{_{wb}}\f$ given an \f$\MM{M}{_{wb}}\f$.
     *
     *  \f$\begin{eqnarray*}
     *  \MM{Q}{_{wb}}\T\MM{M}{_{wb}}&=&\M{1} \\
     *  \MM{Q}{_{wb}}\T\MM{M}{_{wb}}\MM{M}{_{wb}}^{-1}&=&\M{1}\MM{M}{_{wb}}^{-1} \\
     *  \MM{Q}{_{wb}}\T&=&\MM{M}{_{wb}}^{-1} \\
     *  \MM{Q}{_{wb}}&=&(\MM{M}{_{wb}}^{-1})\T \\
     *  \end{eqnarray*}\f$
     *
     *  And there it is. There is a matrix that transforms a normal from body to world space,
     *  that only depends on matrix \f$\MM{M}{_{wb}}\f$, not on any of the vectors.
     *
     *  Since this is commonly used, we will ask our transformation chain to calculate it
     *  at the same time that it concatenates all of the transformations into a single matrix.
     *
     *  Note that this transformation does not promise to preserve the length of the normal.
     *  Since some algorithms (Snell's law etc) depend on the normal having unit length,
     *  we will make sure to return a unit normal.
     *
     *  Also, if the primitive is inside out, we will reverse the direction of the normal.
